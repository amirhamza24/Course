## In this assignment, 
- It was a Chef details site. In this site, some chefs can be found here. In the first state, their picture, name, review etc. will be seen. To see the details of each chef, click on the "View Recipe" button. If he is logged in then the details can be seen and if he is not logged in then he can be seen by logging in first. 
- If he has not created an account then he has to create a new account.
 
- I am using some Vanila CSS and the popular CSS framework that's called Tailwind. I am highly addicted by Tailwind. Because Tailwind is very much user friendly.
